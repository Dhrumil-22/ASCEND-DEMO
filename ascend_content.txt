ASCEND – Alumni–Student Career ENgagement Dashboard 
 
Problem Deﬁni Ɵon 
In many higher- educaƟon insƟtuƟons, junior students lack structured and reliable access to 
seniors and alumni who have prac Ɵcal industry experience. Exis Ɵng communica Ɵon 
methods such as social media groups, informal messaging, and no Ɵce boards suﬀe r from 
several limita Ɵons: 
 Lack of veriﬁca Ɵon and accountability of career advice  
 RepeƟƟve and low -quality ques Ɵons 
 Mentor overload leading to disengagement 
 Generic guidance that does not match a student’s background 
 Absence of measurable outcomes to evaluate advice quality 
These issues result in ineﬃcient knowledge transfer and poor career decision-making among 
students. 
 
Proposed System 
The proposed project is a web-based mentorship and career guidance pla ƞorm developed 
using Python for backend processing  and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for 
frontend design . 
The system focuses on structured interac Ɵon, fairness, and accountability , rather than real-
Ɵme chat-based communica Ɵon. Mentorship is delivered asynchronously, ensuring 
scalability and sustainability. 
 
ObjecƟves 
1. To provide structured and meaningful career guidance to junior students 
2. To reduce mentor workload through controlled and fair ques Ɵon handling  
3. To evaluate mentorship quality using outcome-based feedback 
4. To apply Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)  within real system workﬂows 
5. To design a scalable and modular web applica Ɵon using Python

System Features 
1. User Roles 
 Junior Student:  Can submit structured career or technical queries 
 Senior/Alumni Mentor:  Can respond to assigned queries 
 Administrator:  Manages veriﬁca Ɵon, modera Ɵon, and system integrity  
 
2. Structured Ques Ɵon Submission  
Juniors must submit queries in a predeﬁned format including: 
 Current skill set 
 Target career role 
 Previous a Ʃempts or prepara Ɵon 
 Speciﬁc ques Ɵon descrip Ɵon 
This ensures high-quality inputs and reduces unnecessary mentor eﬀort. 
 
3. Asynchronous Mentorship Model 
 Real-Ɵme chat is avoided  
 Mentors respond at their convenience 
 Improves response quality and system sustainability 
 
4. Outcome-Based Trust System 
 Juniors provide delayed feedback on guidance received 
 Trust score is calculated based on measurable outcomes 
 Prevents misleading or low-quality advice 
 
5. Similarity- Based Mentor Recommenda Ɵon 
Mentors are suggested based on: 
 Academic background 
 Skill level

 Career trajectory 
This provides realis Ɵc and relevant guidance.  
 
IntegraƟon of Data Structures and Algorithms  
To saƟsfy academic and prac Ɵcal requirements, the project integrates DSA into core system 
logic: 
Data Structure / 
Algorithm ApplicaƟon in System  Purpose 
Queue (FIFO)  Mentor Ques Ɵon 
Scheduling Ensures fairness and prevents 
overload 
Priority Queue  Urgent Career Queries  Handles deadline -based requests  
Stack (LIFO)  Admin Modera Ɵon 
Rollback Enables undo func Ɵonality 
Hash Map  Mentor Matching  Fast lookup and eﬃcient mapping  
SorƟng Algorithms  ReputaƟon Ranking  Displays top mentors  
These structures are used as part of the system’s func Ɵonal workﬂow, not as standalone 
demonstra Ɵons. 
 
Technology Stack

Database 
 MySQL / PostgreSQL 
Architecture 
 MVC / Layered Architecture 
 Role-based authen ƟcaƟon 
 
System Feasibility 
 The project is modular and can be completed within a single semester 
 Core features are priori Ɵzed for Ɵmely comple Ɵon 
 Advanced features can be implemented as extensions 
 Requires no paid APIs or external services 
 
Expected Outcomes 
 A funcƟonal, secure, and scalable web applica Ɵon 
 Demonstra Ɵon of Python backend development skills  
 PracƟcal applica Ɵon of Data Structures and Algorithms  
 Improved mentorship eﬃciency within an academic environment
