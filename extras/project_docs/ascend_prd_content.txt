1. ExecuƟve Summary  
1.1 Product Vision 
ASCEND is a college-speciﬁc alumni- student mentorship pla ƞorm that revolu Ɵonizes career 
guidance by connec Ɵng junior students with seniors and alumni working at speciﬁc 
companies. Unlike generic mentorship pla ƞorms, ASCEND enables students to discove r 
mentors based on their target companies (e.g., Odoo, Google, TCS) and receive hyper-
targeted, company- speciﬁc career guidance, interview prepara Ɵon, roadmaps, and referral 
opportuni Ɵes through a structured, asynchronous mentorship model.  
1.2 Problem Statement 
Current Challenges:  
Junior students in higher educa Ɵon insƟtuƟons face signiﬁcant barriers when seeking career 
guidance from experienced professionals: 
 Lack of Structured Access:  No centralized pla ƞorm to discover which seniors/alumni 
work at speciﬁc target companies 
 Low Response Rates:  Cold messaging on LinkedIn yields <10% response rate; 
WhatsApp groups are chao Ɵc and unstructured  
 Generic Advice:  Career counseling is too broad and not tailored to speciﬁc 
companies or roles 
 No Accountability:  No way to verify quality of advice or track outcomes 
 Mentor Burnout:  Alumni get overwhelmed with repe ƟƟve quesƟons and random 
messages 
 Missing Company Context:  Students can't ﬁnd insider informa Ɵon about company 
culture, interview processes, or prepara Ɵon strategies  
 No Referral Pipeline:  Informal networks make it diﬃcult to request and track 
referrals 
Impact: These issues result in ineﬃcient knowledge transfer, poor career decision-making, 
missed opportuni Ɵes, and underu ƟlizaƟon of valuable alumni networks.  
1.3 Proposed Solu Ɵon 
ASCEND addresses these challenges through: 
--- Page 3 ---
1. Company-Based Discovery:  Students search mentors by target company, not just 
skills 
2. Asynchronous Structured Mentorship:  QuesƟon-answer model (not real- Ɵme chat) 
with mandatory context ﬁelds 
3. Fair Queue Management:  FIFO-based distribu Ɵon prevents mentor overload using 
Data Structures 
4. Outcome-Based Trust System:  Quality control through delayed feedback on advice 
eﬀecƟveness 
5. Intelligent Matching:  Algorithm matches students with most relevant mentors based 
on company, skills, and availability 
6. Referral Workﬂow:  Formal pipeline from guidance → por ƞolio building → referral 
request 
7. Knowledge Base:  Searchable archive of answered ques Ɵons reduces duplicate 
queries

10.3 Indexing Strategy 
Purpose: OpƟmize query performance for frequent opera Ɵons 
Indexes to Create:  
 users(email) - UNIQUE # Fast login lookup 
 students(roll_number) - UNIQUE 
 alumni(current_company_id) # Company-alumni ﬁltering 
 work_history(alumni_id, company_id) # Mentor matching 
 work_history(company_id) # Company page queries 
 quesƟons(student_id, status) # Student dashboard  
 quesƟons(assigned_mentor_id, status) # Mentor queue  
 quesƟons(company_id, status) # Company Q&A archive  
 responses(ques Ɵon_id) # O(1) response lookup  
 noƟﬁcaƟons(user_id, is_read, created_at) # No ƟﬁcaƟon feed 
10.4 Data Integrity Constraints 
Foreign Key Constraints:  
 ON DELETE CASCADE: no ƟﬁcaƟons (when user deleted)  
 ON DELETE SET NULL: ques Ɵons.assigned_mentor_id (if mentor account deleted)  
 ON DELETE RESTRICT: work_history.company_id (prevent company dele Ɵon if history 
exists) 
Check Constraints:  
--- Page 72 ---
 students.cgpa BETWEEN 0.00 AND 10.00 
 alumni.trust_score BETWEEN 0.00 AND 100.00 
 quesƟons.urgency IN ('normal', 'high', 'urgent')  
 feedback.ra Ɵng BETWEEN 1 AND 5  
Unique Constraints:  
 (student_id, company_id) in student_target_companies # No duplicate wishlist 
entries 
 quesƟon_id in responses # One response per ques Ɵon 
 quesƟon_id in feedback # One feedback per ques Ɵon 
 
11. User Interface Speciﬁca Ɵons 
11.1 Design Principles 
Visual Design:  
 Color Scheme:   
o Primary: #2563EB (Blue) - Trust, professionalism 
o Secondary: #10B981 (Green) - Success, posi Ɵve outcomes  
o Accent: #F59E0B (Amber) - Highlights, calls-to- acƟon 
o Neutral: #6B7280 (Gray) - Text, backgrounds 
o Error: #EF4444 (Red) - Alerts, warnings 
 Typography:   
o Headings: Inter or Poppins (Sans-serif, modern) 
o Body: System fonts (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI") 
o Code: 'Courier New', monospace 
 Spacing: 8px grid system (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px) 
 Border Radius:  8px for cards, 4px for bu Ʃons 
UX Principles:  
 Clarity: Clear labels, no jargon 
 Consistency:  Same UI pa Ʃerns across pages  
--- Page 73 ---
 Feedback:  Visual conﬁrma Ɵon for all ac Ɵons 
 Eﬃciency:  Minimize clicks to complete tasks 
 Accessibility:  Keyboard naviga Ɵon, screen reader support
